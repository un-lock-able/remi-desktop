Remi is a desktop pet that shows what your coding agent is doing — on this machine, or on a server you reach over ssh, **including while you are detached from the session**. She thinks, reads, writes, and stands there unmistakably waiting when the agent is blocked on your approval.

Remi is harness-neutral by design: adapters report neutral events and one reducer turns those into poses. **Claude Code and Codex have hook adapters**; OpenCode is next.

## Since beta.4

- **A Windows machine running an agent can be set up from PowerShell.** `install.ps1` ships beside the binaries and resolves the same asset names and the same `SHASUMS256.txt` as `install.sh` — see below for the incantation that gets arguments past the execution policy (dbb81f6)
- **Codex hooks launch on Windows.** Each hook is now written twice: `command` for a POSIX shell, and `commandWindows`, the same path unquoted. Codex runs the override through `cmd.exe /d /c "<command>"`, which loses a command whose first character is a quote, so the quoted POSIX spelling never started there. The override is written on every platform, so one `CODEX_HOME` shared between machines says the same thing on each (dbb81f6)
- Hooks an earlier Remi wrote, without that override, are still recognised as hers — `check` reports them and `uninstall` takes them out — but no longer match what `setup` writes, so `check` sends you to run `setup` again (dbb81f6)
- The README now shows **what each of the seven poses looks like** (3412a23)

## Install the pet

**macOS** (11+, Intel and Apple Silicon) — download `Remi-*-macos-universal.app.tar.gz`, unpack it, and move `Remi.app` to `/Applications`. The build is **not signed**, so Gatekeeper will refuse it on first launch. Clear the quarantine flag:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Remi.app
```

On macOS 15 and later the old right-click → Open bypass is gone; the alternative to the command above is System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway.

Remi has no Dock icon. Her session menu is in the **menu bar**, and a **right-click on her** opens the same thing — pick a session, connect to a host, change her size, hide her, quit.

**Windows 10/11** — download either `Remi-*-windows-x86_64.msi` or `Remi-*-windows-x86_64-setup.exe`. Also unsigned, so SmartScreen will warn: *More info* → *Run anyway*.

**Linux x86_64** — download `Remi-*-linux-x86_64.deb` or `.AppImage`. Install the deb with
`sudo apt install ./Remi-*-linux-x86_64.deb`, or `chmod +x` the AppImage and run it. Remi prefers
X11 / XWayland for position restoration and always-on-top; native Wayland falls back to compositor
window rules. These packages are Spine-only, like the macOS and Windows builds; if the pet never
appears, WebKitGTK could not composite the WebGL canvas — install the `-gif-fallback` package
instead. GNOME needs AppIndicator support for the tray.

## Teach a machine to talk to her

Every machine running an agent — including your laptop — needs `remi-hook`, which writes what the agent is doing to a small state file. One command, on that machine:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/un-lock-able/remi-desktop/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --harness claude-code --check
```

It downloads the right binary for the machine, verifies it against `SHASUMS256.txt`, installs it to `~/.local/bin/remi-hook`, and configures the harness you named — for Claude Code, merging into `~/.claude/settings.json` alongside your own hooks and keeping a `.bak`. Then it prints what the pet will see. `--harness` has no default: name `claude-code` or `codex`, and install both on a machine that runs both. Run this any time to check:

```sh
~/.local/bin/remi-hook check --harness claude-code
```

For Codex, use `remi-hook setup --harness codex --check`. Restart Codex and review/trust the
new hooks with `/hooks` in the CLI. Setup preserves `config.toml`, other hooks and `notify`.
Check with `remi-hook check --harness codex`; remove with `remi-hook uninstall --harness codex`.
Use a Codex runtime with lifecycle-hook support. Reply streaming and arbitrary shell-command
classification are not available through this adapter.

**On Windows**, PowerShell installs the same binary. The execution policy blocks a downloaded
script, so build it in memory rather than saving it — which is also what lets you pass it the
arguments `irm | iex` cannot:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod `
  https://github.com/un-lock-able/remi-desktop/releases/latest/download/install.ps1))) `
  --harness codex --check
```

Everything after the script is forwarded to `remi-hook setup`, so `--harness` is required here
too. It installs `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\remi-hook.exe`, fetching
`remi-hook-windows-x86_64.exe` — the only Windows build, which an ARM64 machine runs under
emulation. If you install by hand instead, keep the binary named `remi-hook.exe`, which is how
setup recognises its own hooks, and put it somewhere **without a space in the path**: on
Windows a Codex hook command has no working form for a path containing one.

To undo Claude Code setup: `remi-hook uninstall --harness claude-code`. `--purge` is not implemented.

## Known limits in this beta

- **Nothing is code-signed.** See the quarantine and SmartScreen notes above.
- **The pet does not install the hook for you.** Even for your own machine, run the script above.
- **No autostart.** Add Remi to your login items yourself.
- **Claude Code hooks do not run on Windows.** Its settings schema rejects unknown keys in a hook entry, so Remi cannot write the `commandWindows` override there; a file that fails that schema stops Claude Code with a dialog at session start. Codex is the harness to use on a Windows agent machine for now.
- **OpenCode is not implemented.** `--harness opencode` is accepted by the CLI but its plugin is not written yet.
